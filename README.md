# Blogger

Blogger is a simple blog site created by following the tutorial found [here](http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/blogger.html). It was a fun way to learn Ruby on Rails. I noticed there were a lot of similarities to ASP.NET MVC pattern.

## Features
These are some of the features of the simple blog:
* Create/Edit/Delete posts
* Upload pictures
* Leave comments
